  "description": "Extended VR Firefighting Simulation with new features and realistic scenarios. Based on the Flamecoach project, this enhanced simulation provides a highly realistic training environment for firefighting. Improvements include a redesigned fire system and user interface, expanded scenarios, and the ability to operate multiple fire extinguishers simultaneously. The goal is to make the training experience even more practical and flexible.",
